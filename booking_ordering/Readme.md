# How to run

To run the solution, you just need to make sure that you have python 3.7 installed.

You can get the python 3.7 installation here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

The solution is contained inside the CarBookingOrderSolver.py script. To run the script we only need to run 
it and supply the file name containing the json data when prompted, example (data.json is the json file listed in the challenge repo) and also the file name that will contain the solution:

```
 ~/workspace/smove_challenge/booking_ordering ● $ python CarBookingOrderSolver.py
Enter json file name containing booking orders (use data.json for default data):data.json
Enter output json file: output.json
```

CarBookingOrderSolverTest.py is the unit tests used for testing
the solver.
