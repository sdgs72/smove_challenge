# How to run

To run the solution, you just need to make sure that you have python 3.7 installed.

You can get the python 3.7 installation here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

The solution is contained inside the CarBookingOrderSolver.py script. To run the script we only need to run 
it and supply a file, example (data.json is the json file listed in the challenge repo):

```
python CarBookingOrderSolver data.json
```

CarBookingOrderSolverTest.py is the unit tests used for testing
the solver.
